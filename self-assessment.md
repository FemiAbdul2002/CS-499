üëã Professional Self-Assessment ‚Äì Femi Abdul

Welcome to my CS 499 Capstone Portfolio. My name is Femi Abdul, and this ePortfolio reflects my journey through the Computer Science program at SNHU. This experience has challenged me to grow not only as a student, but as a future contributor in the tech industry. From building mobile apps to writing reinforcement learning agents, this portfolio showcases the development of my technical skillset and critical thinking across key domains of computer science.



üéØ Personal Growth and Goals

My initial interest in computer science came from a desire to build efficient, real-world tools that solve problems. While my career path is evolving beyond traditional coding roles, the process of understanding how software works ‚Äî from architecture to implementation ‚Äî has deepened my respect for technology and broadened my problem-solving approach. 

This program has helped sharpen my ability to break down complex logic, analyze data structures, and develop modular, scalable solutions. I‚Äôm now focused on combining my technical background with strategic and creative opportunities, including entrepreneurship, content creation, and product innovation.



ü§ù Teamwork & Collaboration

Throughout the program, collaboration played an essential role in projects. I learned to navigate group challenges using Git for version control and shared contributions. Whether working on object-oriented designs or debugging application flows, communicating technical details clearly and respectfully within a team setting helped me build interpersonal skills that translate well to workplace environments.



üó£Ô∏è Communication with Stakeholders

A significant part of this capstone experience involved creating code reviews and narrative explanations for each enhancement. These opportunities sharpened my ability to communicate ideas clearly and explain why a solution is effective, both to technical and non-technical audiences. Being able to translate complex logic into digestible summaries is critical when working with business stakeholders or presenting final products.



 üß† Algorithms & Data Structures

One of the major milestones in this program was optimizing algorithms to solve real-world problems. My enhancement of the Pirate Intelligent Agent (originally from CS-370) helped me explore how reinforcement learning agents use Q-learning to navigate decision-making environments. Adjusting the learning rate and exploration strategy taught me how small changes in parameters significantly impact algorithm performance ‚Äî something I can carry into future AI-based projects.



üß± Software Engineering & Database Design

The course also strengthened my foundation in modular coding and scalable system design. I practiced separating logic into reusable components, improving readability and long-term maintainability. For the database enhancement (coming in Module 5), I‚Äôm preparing to integrate persistent storage using a SQL-based or JSON system to store Q-table values. This will simulate real-world scenarios where data needs to persist between training sessions.



üîí Security Mindset

Security was another critical takeaway. The habit of thinking like an adversary ‚Äî considering where vulnerabilities might exist, even in simple projects ‚Äî is now something I bring to every technical review. From validating input to planning for secure data storage, the coursework taught me to design with integrity, resilience, and foresight.



üß≥ Bringing It All Together

This portfolio includes:
- A software design enhancement (Milestone Two)
- An algorithmic logic improvement (Milestone Three)
- A planned database integration (Milestone Four)
- Supporting narratives that align with key course outcomes

While I may not pursue a traditional software developer role, I‚Äôve gained a toolkit of technical and strategic skills that will support my goals across multiple industries ‚Äî including tech entrepreneurship, digital media, and product leadership.



Thank you for reviewing my ePortfolio. I look forward to continuing to grow and apply what I‚Äôve learned in meaningful and creative ways.
