Artifact Description
The artifact I selected is from my CS-370 course, titled the Pirate Intelligent Agent Project. It was originally created as a reinforcement learning (RL) project where an AI agent learns to navigate a treasure maze using the Q-learning algorithm. The code includes a maze environment (TreasureMaze class), a neural network model (build_model function), and the Q-learning training process (qtrain function). I chose this artifact because it reflects solid software design principles, modular architecture, and a real-world AI application.

Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio
This artifact showcases my skills in modular software engineering, algorithm design, and neural network integration. Enhancing this project gave me the opportunity to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability â€” all critical traits of professional-quality software. Specifically, I:
Refactored the code to be more modular and readable.


Enhanced commenting and documentation, making it easier for others to understand.


Improved the architecture of the training loop to allow future upgrades like database integration.


Followed design principles by separating concerns (maze logic, training logic, and model design).


These updates demonstrate my growing capability to write clean, well-structured code that solves complex problems.

Course Outcomes Achieved
In Module One, I planned to meet outcomes related to software engineering and design, and I have achieved that. I successfully demonstrated:
Implementation of modular code design.


Use of programming techniques that support AI learning systems.


Incorporation of software engineering principles to make the artifact extensible.


For future milestones, I plan to build on this enhancement by incorporating a simple database to persist training data, which will support outcomes related to databases and security-conscious design.

Reflection on the Enhancement Process
While working on this enhancement, I learned how much thoughtful design can impact the long-term usability of a codebase. I gained a better understanding of how to separate concerns in code, improve documentation, and prepare code for scalability. One challenge was identifying which parts of the training logic needed abstraction without losing clarity. Another was making sure any changes still allowed the agent to train effectively.
This experience reinforced the importance of writing maintainable code not just functional code, especially for team collaboration or future modifications. The improvements I made have made the artifact more robust and representative of real-world software development practices.
